 * @title Attestations Registry
 * @author Sismo
 * @notice Main contract of Sismo, stores all recorded attestations in attestations collections
 * Only authorized attestations issuers can record attestation in the registry
 * Attesters that expect to record in the Attestations Registry must be authorized issuers
 * For more information: https://attestations-registry.docs.sismo.io

 * For each attestation recorded, a badge is received by the user
 * The badge is the Non transferrable NFT representation of an attestation 
 * Its ERC1155 contract is stateless, balances are read directly from the registry. Badge balances <=> Attestations values
 * After the creation or update of an attestation, the registry triggers a TransferSingle event from the ERC1155 Badges contracts
 * It enables off-chain apps such as opensea to catch the "shadow mint" of the badge

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
